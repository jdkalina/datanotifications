The goal is to create an automated collection of change notifications disseminated by Refinitiv on websites.

To this end we'll use Python and a specific package called Selenium, which is an adapted package for website automation and testing. 

Important: You can't just download the selenium package, newer versions of the package require that you also install and webdriver from either chrome or firefox. Some easy Google-fu for 'Chrome Webdriver' should do the trick. You'll need to create a path to the webdriver after you've installed it on your cpu.
